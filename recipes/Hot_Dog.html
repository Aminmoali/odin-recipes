    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hot dogs are a traditional element of American food culture.</p>
    <p>The name 'hot dog' possibly began as a joke about their thin, long and small dogs</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large saucepan</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Hot dogs</li>
        <li>Tongs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with enough water to cover hot dogs (about 1 cup per hot dog).</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the hot dogs one at a time using tongs.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to the low setting and allow the hot dogs to simmer for anywhere from 3 to 6 minutes (the longer they simmer, the crispier they'll be).</li>
        <li>Once they're done, use tongs to remove them from the water and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
